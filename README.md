# Introduction to Programming by Exercises
This repo is intended for learning programming with C language

## Why do we have C version here?
For the C language version, I was and I'm a fresher and a fan. I first started to learn programming using C#, and when I got my first job I became a full time Python Developer instead of C/C++, which many students will may learn and take part in when they choose this career path. However, after working for a while, I want to have a deeper understanding about programming world, how computer works how bits are manipulated then C is my first stop. 

To have a better understanding of C, I believe practice will help me to achieve a higher standard for myself.

## Where did I get of these excercises?
Since I'm a beginner in C, these excercises are copied from Hackerrank/Leetcode. For each problem I will try to attach the link lead to the title.

## Other versions
The Python and JavaScript version (you can check the branches) where my team and I design our own excercises to practice, since we are more familiar with these languages.
