# Introduction to programming with Python
## This repo is intended for practicing purposes

In September 2022 at University of Economics and Law,  I had a chance to take part in a teaching assitant position which was guided by two great teachers of mine. Although I was inexperience with this new role, my beloved teachers and my junior students had got me through this period. 

This repo was and is created **for anyone is fond of programming, who's looking for a place to practice their skills and sharpen their logics** which is based on what I taught and learned with my class.

We currently have 2 languages in this repo which are Python and C. As Python is a really easy to learn, easy to adapt language, C is lower level, however, you will learn a lot from it, especially about how computers work.

Enjoy your journey, any contributions and suggestions are welcome!

> No pain no gain! Practice makes perfect!
